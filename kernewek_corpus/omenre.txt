#          HERE BEGINNETH THE DRAMA OF THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD. 
                                      
                                      
#   GOD THE FATHER
   I am called the Father of Heaven,
   Creator of everything that is made.
   We are truly Three in One,
   The Father, the Son and the Spirit,
   And today I desire                        5
   By my power to start the world.
   Heaven and earth, I say,
   Let them be formed according to my judgment.
                                      
   Now that Heaven is created for us
   and filled with angels bright,           10
   we will create the earth
   inasmuch as we are Three and One,
   the Father, the Son and the Spirit.
   Surely, most royally
   are these made                           15
   as we ourselves would have them.
                                      
   On the second day I will
   make the sky called heaven,
   for all that has been made
   the first day seems good to me.          20
   Let sky be above everything
   to overshadow all that is created,
   to hold rain above
   to be broadcast upon the earth.
                                      
   On the third day I make a division       25
   between the sea and the lands
   and on land I command
   trees and plants to grow.
   Let every tree grow upright
   bearing its fruit and leaves,            30
   and let the plants bear seed
   in sheltered places in time for summer.
                                      
   On the fourth day
   let bright lights for the whole world
   be made to perfection
   and their names shall be                 35
   the sun and the moon and the starlight.
   Above the trees in the midst of the sky
   above I set the moon by night and
   the sun by day to give a shining light.  40
                                      
   On the fifth day my will is
   that beasts, fish and birds
   be created by my power
   to fill land and sea,
   for the time will come                   45
   when it will be better because of them.
   I command them -
   let them increase and live long.
                                      
#   Here God comes down from the upper stage and God says: [Here Lucifer
#   acts from heaven]
                                      
   Today is the sixth day
   since I began work                       50
   in which I made heaven, sea, land and trees,
   beasts, fish, lights.
   Everything that is created in them
   shall be obedient to me.
   I intend mankind to be formed            55
   from clay to perfection.
                                      
#   Here let him make Adam, and God says:- 
                                      
   As we are One and Three,
   Father and Son in Trinity,
   presently we shall make you, you man,
   from clay, in appearance like us.        60
   We shall breathe a spirit
   into your body so that you can live,
   and when you lose the life
   you will return again to the earth.
                                      
   Adam, stand up quietly                   65
   and turn to flesh and blood.
   Bear in mind that I am making you
   from earth like me from head to foot.
   Receive power over all
   that is on land or sea.                  70
   You will live on this earth
   to bring forth offspring until you are grey.
                                      
   Adam, as I am God of Grace,
   I grant to you to be a warden.
   I give you authority over paradise       75
   over every fruit, plant and seed
   which grows in it. Just do one thing for me. Only as regards the fruit
   which is called the Tree of Knowledge
   you will not have permission.            80
                                      
   If you eat of this
   which is called the Tree of Knowledge
   you will go out of here
   and death irrevocable shall be yours.
                                      
#   ADAM 
   O Father, Son and Holy Ghost,            85
   eternal praise to your dear person.
   By making me whole and unblemished
   you have made me very like you.
                                      
   In my judgment
   there is enough to ordain my life.       90
   I have a great desire to have
   a female companion arranged for me.
#                          [They go to paradise]
#   GOD THE FATHER
   It is not good indeed that a man
   should be alone without a mate or mistress.
   Go and lie
   on the clean earth and sleep.
   Do not stand up at all
   until a female companion is created.
                                      
#   And Adam will sleep. Here God makes Eve and will bring her to Adam and
#   he shall take her by the hand, and God the Father says:
   Forthwith from one of your ribs
   I make you a peer                       100
   to help you at all times.
   Adam, here she is.
   Give her a name
   so as to take her for your equal.
                                      
#   EVE
   Lord God of Heaven, Father,             105
   inasmuch as you are full of grace
   may you be for ever worshipped
   as you have done much for me
   by forming me like you.
   You are one God and Three Persons.      110
#                                [Eve goes out] 
#   ADAM
   O Father, you have given me
   bone which was from my flesh and body
   to be my partner.
                                      
   I name her Virago.
   May the Father God be worshipped        115
   who has ordained her for me for my benefit.
                                      
#   GOD THE FATHER
   Adam, behold the fish,
   the birds of the air and the beasts
   on both land and sea.
   Give them their names.                  120
   They will come at your bidding
   but do not oppress them in any way.
                                      
#   ADAM
   I name cow and bull
   and horse, which is a beast without equal
   for the benefit of mankind;             125
   goat, hind, stag,
   sheep (in a few words) -
   let her receive her good name.
                                      
   Now I name goose and hen
   which I esteem birds without equal      130
   as food for mankind upon the earth;
   duck, peacock, doves, partridges,
   swan, buzzard, crows and the eagle.
   More will be named by me.
                                      
   I give names to the fish;               135
   porpoise, salmon, eels;
   all will be obedient to me,
   ling and codfish.
   No fish will escape me
   if I worship God perfectly.             140
                                      
#   GOD THE FATHER
   Because everything created in six days
   is all complete and good,
                                      
   we shall bless them
   so that the seventh day may be hallowed,
   that is as a day of rest                145
   for every man who is saved.
   As a demonstration of that,
   we shall rest immediately.
                                      
#   Then God the Father shall go to heaven and afterwards the devil as a
#   serpent speaks to Eve in the Tree of Knowledge and speaks wickedly to
#   Eve. 
                                      
#   SERPENT that is DEMON
   Eve, why do you not come near
   to chat and talk to me                  150
   I know one thing that would
   delight you if you knew it.
   You would laugh for ever
   for joy and happiness.
   You would rise up to heaven             155
   just like a goddess.
                                      
#   EVE
   What can that be?
   Tell me straight away!
                                      
#   DEMON
   Eve, I cannot say
   for fear you would denounce me.         160
                                      
#   EVE
   You can tell me
   because I am a woman.
   On no account would
   I ever accuse you.
                                      
#   DEMON
   I came down from heaven.                165
   Be of good cheer, dear Eve.
   Do not hesitate to eat fruit
   from the Tree of Knowledge.
                                      
#   EVE
   Hurry away at once!
   Don't say another word to me.           170
   I have no wish to eat its fruit
   contrary to my dear Lord's ban.
                                      
#   DEMON
   O woman, how silly you are
   not to trust my words!
   If only you and your husband were to eat
   of the tree and its fruits
   you would surely
   now be like gods.
   Eve, come close; take them,
   for I do not tell you a lie.            180
                                      
#   EVE
   He who made me and my husband
   forbade us
   to eat the fruit
   or go near the tree.
                                      
#   DEMON
   I know the reason why:                  185
   because it is a tree of grace.
   Whoever eats of its fruit
   will know the mind of the Father.
   There won't be a thing in the country round
   about that he will not be able to report.
   It is great foolishness on his part
   if he leaves this fruit.
                                      
#   EVE
   I am bemused thinking
   what I may do
   by picking the apple                    195
   for fear that you are deceitful
                                      
#   DEVIL
   Pick it at my risk.
   Get it done quickly without hesitating,
   and also make your husband
   eat some of it.                         200
                                      
#   EVE 
   Bend the tree towards the ground
   so that I can reach them.
                                      
#   DEVIL
   I will, but come quietly.
   Pick it and get away.
                                      
#  Then (Eve) shall take the apple, and carry it to Adam, and Eve says:- 
                                      
#   EVE
   Adam, stretch out your hand to me.      205
   Take this from me
   quietly without making a fuss.
   Eat it immediately.
#                  [Adam shall go to paradise.]
#   ADAM
   Tell me, woman,
   where did you pick the fruit            210
   in case it was that same kind
   that was forbidden us?
                                      
#   EVE 
   When I was taking a walk
   I heard an angel
   beginning to sing                       215
   above me on one side of the tree.
   He advised me
   to pick fruit from it.
   We would be greater than a god
   so that we would never be troubled.     220
                                      
#   ADAM
   Oh! out upon you, wicked woman,
   since you trusted him
   for it was a bird of ill omen
   you heard singing
   that will bring us to grief             225
   unless we pull back.
   Let everyone think about his end,
   how he may finish.
                                      
#   EVE
   Quiet! The angel held forth
   about the tree and its power.           230
   Anyone who ate its fruit
   would be like a god.
                                      
#   ADAM
   I will not believe you
   or your treacherous words.
   Let us pray that we may be servants     235
   to our peerless Lord
   for he who made us from clay
   gave us a prohibition without exception
   that we should not eat the fruit
   of the tree.                            240
                                      
#   EVE
   Since you will not believe
   you will lose my love.
   As long as you live
   you will never see me here again.
                                      
#   ADAM
   Eve, rather than your being angry,      245
   I will do all you wish.
   Bring it me immediately
   and I will eat it.
                                      
#   And then he eats some of the apple, and sees that he is naked, and
#   says with a groan:- 
                                      
   Oh, woe, woe, I have sinned,
   and have broken the prohibition.        250
   O evil, impious woman,
   surely you have deceived me without cause.
   Our bodies have become naked.
   Let us cover ourselves with leaves.
   I know truly, God the Father
#    [woman.]
   has become angry through the deed of a
#          [Adam hides himself in paradise.] 
                                      
#   Then God the Father shall come to Adam, and he says to him:-
#   GOD THE FATHER
   Adam, Adam, what are you doing?
   Why don't you come to welcome me?
                                      
#   ADAM
   Because I was naked, without covering,
   I went to hide from you.                260
                                      
#   GOD THE FATHER
   Who showed you
   that your body, feet and arms are naked
   but the fruit which you
   could not go and eat, except by sinning?
                                      
#   ADAM
   You gave me a wife.                     265
   She is all to blame
   who picked the beautiful apple
   and brought it to me to taste.
                                      
#   GOD THE FATHER
   Because you listened to her
   and acted against my ban,               270
   I will surely curse the earth
   perpetually on account of your deed.
                                      
   You will toil in your sweat to eat
   until your dying day
   with thorn and briars growing so as     275
   to be troublesome as long as you exist.
                                      
   Eve, why did you
   deceive your husband without cause
   by picking the apple
   after I had forbidden you?              280
   You have done evil indeed
   and brought him to great sorrow
   when you made him taste
   and eat the fruit of the tree.

#              [Here let the Devil be present.] 
                                      
#   EVE
   O loving Father in your glory,          285
   the serpent has deceived me.
   I believed its falsehood.
   Greed has ruined me.
   It said that if he picked it,
   he would be like a god.                 290
   If what I did was evil,
   cut it down with your sword.
                                      
#   GOD THE FATHER
   Because you have trusted it
   and deceived your loyal spouse,
   I ordain that woman be for ever         295
   obedient to her husband
   so that her affliction is increased
   through the breaking of my command
   so that indeed she will never
   have a child without great labour.      300

#                   [He speaks to the Serpent.]
                                      
   Answer me, you devil.
   Why did you deceive her without cause
   by tempting her to pick the fruit
   in defiance of my prohibition?
                                      
#   DEVIL
   I will tell you the position:           305
   because they had such great happiness,
   and I was always burning.
   For this I tempted them
   to sin, so that "Alas" might be
   their song like mine.                   310
                                      
#   GOD THE FATHER
   So you will be accursed,
   very truly beyond all the beasts
   which walk on the face of the earth
   and there will always be enmity
   everlasting between your offspring      315
   and the offspring of the woman.
                                      
   Here you will not remain.

#   He speaks to Adam and Eve. The Devil goes home. (This does not appear
#   in Norris)

   Go outside immediately.
   You will lose my joy
   which I gave you in paradise.           320
   It is useless to make the excuse
   that it was picked by your wife.
   Because you listened to her
   a thousand mothers' sons will be condemned.
                                      
#   ADAM
   O Father, God, in your glory,           325
   grant to your creature, I pray you,
   a little of the Oil of Mercy.
                                      
#   GOD THE FATHER 
   Adam, at the end of the world,
   I will grant the Oil of Mercy to you,
   and to Eve your wife.                   330
                                      
#   And then God ascends to heaven, and says to the cherub: 
#   Cherub, take a sword, hasten to paradise.
                                      
   You will find two persons there.
   Put them outside immediately.
   It will be of great import to them      335
   and to all who are created.
   They will surely curse the time
   when they did wrong.
                                      
#   CHERUB
   I will go to paradise at once
   to do just what you want.
   If I find people there,
   they will be put outside.

#                  [Here the cherub goes down.]

   towards another land to live,
   you yourself to dig,                    345
   your wife with you to spin,

   Hurry to the door

   Alas, to see the time
   when I angered my Lord,
   when I acted against his command,
   I have lost my inheritance.
   I do not know at all where I shall go now.
   I have no lodging, shelter or house.
   My whole heart will break
   in pieces for grief.
                                      
   Away from my joy and my delight
   I must depart in devastation.           360

   we shall nearly perish with cold.
                                      
   In our wretched state we do not know
   where to go, in field or wood.
   With my stomach empty, famine           365

   to spin clothes for us

#   CAIN
   O dear father, I will do so.
   May the Lord of Heaven grant me
   to do well in whatever I might do.      445
   Dear Abel, let us go

   I will go with you to the mount,        450
   but before going, my dear father,
   give me your perfect blessing

   the sooner to obtain mercy.
   Your blessing is most delightful to me, 455

#   CAIN
   By my faith, it is a great folly
   to go and burn a thing
   which a man can live on.                475
   What worship is it to God
   for a tithe to be burnt
   to charred ashes on the rocks?
                                      
#   ABEL
   Dear Cain, think of your soul.
   For the sake of the Father God of Heaven,
   do his commands.
   Nothing will afflict us
   since it surely is his will
   to burn it without fail.
                                      
#   CAIN
   Not so, Abel, don't do that.           485
   I will never do so.
   I have thought of a subterfuge
   to preserve it for the summer.
                                      
#   ABEL
   Surely you are foolish and mad.
   If you do not do as I say
#          [torment]
   I believe you will have most lamentable
   In the region of hell.
                                      
   By his full grace and mercy,
   God has given to us the nine tenths
   to live on in security.                 495
   Now, why should he not claim entitlement
   to his tenth without hassle,
   and burn it, since he wants to?

#   [Here all shall come into the playing area.]
                                      
#   And then let Cain offer a part of the tithes, that he may keep another
#   part of the tithes; and Cain says:-
                                      
#   CAIN
   Between you and me,
   I will certainly not offer              500
   all my tithe.
   O Father God, full of pity,
   take, receive from me
   my tithe and my pure offering
                                      
   and, God, look at my offering,          505
   and accept my tithe,
   for if you do not, I will
   take it home with me again.
                                      
#   ABEL
   O Father God, supreme Lord,
   I will worship you with all my strength,
   in my heart most solemnly,
   and I will offer to you presently
   my true tithe altogether
   to burn in your honour.
                                      
#   GOD THE FATHER
   Because Abel's tithe is true,           515
   at the end he shall find
   in my land tranquillity

   What? Will not God take note of me,
   nor will what                           520
   I build up not succeed,
   and all the time
   Abel's cattle do a thousand times better? Abel shall pay for it.
                                      
#   ABEL
   My dear brother, let us go home.
   There is a great heaviness
   falling on my heart.
   Whatever it is, by my father,
   may the Father who created me
   accept my offering thankfully,          530
   and when I shall pass away from the world,
   may he bring me to his land.
                                      
#   CAIN
   Dear Abel, do not worry,

   Glad (I would be) if only once          685

   Oil of Mercy eventually

   on that road where I walked
   as we were coming from that place,

   You will see the signs.
   Though you see much light,
   do not be afraid; it will not be other than good.

   Woe to him who lost the country.

   that it is dried up.

   and made all bare because of the sin
   which my father and mother sinned.
   Like the prints of their feet           760
   they are all dry, like mud.
   Alas, that the morsel was eaten.

   All the beauty that I saw
   the tongue of no man in the world can
   ever tell.
   Of good fruit, and beautiful flowers,
   minstrels and sweet song,               770
   a spring bright as silver;
   and flowing from it four streams,
   large indeed, so that
   I wanted to look at them.
                                      
   Against it there is a tall tree,        775
   with many branches,
   but they are all bare, without leaves,
   and around it there was no bark.
   There was none, from top to trunk.
   All its branches are bare.              780
                                      
   And when I looked down,
   I saw its roots
   penetrating right into hell
   in the midst of great darkness
   and its branches growing up             785
   to high heaven bright
   and it was entirely without bark,
   both base and branches.

   high up on a branch,                    805
   a little child newly born,

   and bound fast with napkins.

   when the time is come
   and your mother, and all the good people.

   Take three pips of the apple
   which Adam, your father, ate.

   with many branches,
   and in the middle of its boughs,
   a child wrapped in a swaddling band.    840
                                      
   That is the Oil of Mercy

   these pips are placed in his mouth.     875

   Therefore hasten, go
   and build a ship of smoothed planks     950

   fifty cubits also.
   In height I want her
   to be built thirty cubits.              960
   At the stern you will build
   a narrow door which is called a port.

   Master, I will do so quickly.          1005
   May everything we do
   in this world be agreeable
   to the beloved Father in Heaven.

#   NOAH 
   O dear God, how weary I am
   cutting oak timbers.                   1010
   I never have any rest.
   My limbs are so bruised.
   I would be glad if only I could see
   the day that I am ordered to stop.
   Lord, (I beg for) your pity.           1015
   Woe to him who angers you.
                                      
#   And then God the Father shall come to Noah; and he says to him:- 
                                      
#   GOD THE FATHER
   Now, Noah, go into your ship,
   you and all your household.
   Because you serve me fully
   you will have my peace for ever.       1020
   Take immediately male and female
   of all beasts.
   See you take a pair
   of all the birds that fly
                                      
   to save their progeny,                 1025
   for a week after this,
   for forty days I will allow
   rain to fall from above.
   All the people who are in the land
   or anything living at all,             1030
                                      
   except only you and your children,
   I shall slay with a flood.
                                      
#   NOAH
   O Father, blessed as you are,
   I will carry out your commands.
   I will go from here                    1035
   to my wife and children, in haste.
                                      
#   [Noah says to his wife:-]
                                      
   O faultless spouse,
   sons and daughters likewise,
   by the will of the beloved Father,
   a well-found ship has been provided.   1040
   Let us hurry to it quickly
   for a flood will come upon the earth,
   in which all men and
   all beasts will be drowned together.
                                      
#   WIFE
   O master dear, I will do               1045
   everything as you want.
   Let us all go to the ship quickly
   so that we do not drown with the flood.
                                      
#   SHEM
   As we are commanded
   I will put them into the ship,         1050
   both beasts and birds,
   and let Ham bring food without fail.
                                      
#   HAM
   Look at the load of food on my back.
   Let Japhet bring another load.
   Let us hasten because of the Father,   1055
   for I am very nearly blind through fear.
                                      
#   JAPHET
   I have one good load
   of hay and corn mixed.
   All the beasts which are here
   will have enough food for twelve months.
                                      
#   Then let all go in, men and cattle; and Noah says:- 
                                      
#   NOAH 
   In the name of the best Father,
   let us go in immediately.
   Our ship will be covered
   in rain from above.
   Bring on board at once                 1065
   horses, cattle, pigs, and sheep;
   except the blessed birds;
   they fly quickly and nimbly.
   O Father, as we are your creation,
   formed from clay and mud,              1070
   be our strength and help,
   for we pray to you always.
                                      
#   SHEM
   I will now shelter
   the top of the ship with an awning,
   and this will ensure                   1075
   that the rain does not come in.
                                      
#   HAM
   In the name of God, be he praised,
   rig a cover or we shall be in trouble.
   An ugly shower is brewing,
   by my faith.                           1080
                                      
#   JAPHET
   Look, a severe rainstorm.
   Mankind cannot endure it if it continues for a long time;
   mighty currents gushing
   with great force around the earth.
                                      
#   NOAH
   By grace from heaven and the Father,   1085
   we shall defeat it, however cruel it is.
   Our ship has floated.
   May it save us, Lord on high.
                                      
#   GOD THE FATHER
   Everything in which there was
   the spirit of life is dead.            1090
   I will soon command
   the rain to fall no more.
   Let the flood-stream subside.
   I command it forthwith;
   let it go again to its former course
   so that Noah may till.
                                      
#   NOAH
   The rain has completely gone away
   and the water subsided, I believe.
   It is good to send out a crow,
   to see if there is any dry land on the earth.
                                      
#   SHEM
   I will send it away.
   I do not think it will not come again.
   If it finds carrion,
   it will surely stay on it always.
                                      
#   And then he shall send out a raven, and it did not return.
                                      
#   NOAH
   You told me truly                      1105
   that the raven would not return.
   It is on a great carrion
   carcass eating ruthlessly.
   Set free the dove
   with the blue eyes.                    1110
   By my father, I cannot say
   where there is a more trusty bird.
                                      
#   SHEM
   I will set her free
   straight away, father dear,
   and she will spy out                   1115
   whether there is any dry land in any region.
                                      
#   And then he shall send out the dove, which shall immediately return to
#   the ship, and be taken in. 
                                      
#   HAM 
   I will let her go out
   in the name of the Father.
   Now go, and look well to see
   if there is any dry land in any region.

#   [Here the dove comes, bringing a branch of olive in her mouth.] 
                                      
#   JAPHET
   She has come, and there is
   a branch of green olive in her beak.
   I will take her
   aboard the ship with great speed.
                                      
#   NOAH
   May the Father God be worshipped.      1125
   We are much beholden to love him.
                                      
   Now the floods have receded
   as there are trees drying out.
   My sons, I beg you,
   send out yet a third.                  1130
   If it finds dry ground, I do not think
   it will return to us again.
                                      
#   JAPHET
   I will do your commands
   as you will, father.
   Sweet blue-eyed dove,                  1135
   go, fly over many lands.
   If you really and truly find
   dry land in field or meadow,
   take good care to look there for food
   for your lunch and dinner.             1140

#   And he shall send another dove, which shall return, bringing a branch
#   of olive in her mouth.
                                      
#   SHEM
   Neither near nor far
   do I see her hovering.
   She has safely found
   dry land somewhere.
                                      
#   NOAH
   In the name of the Father on high,     1145
   let us uncover the ship.
   We must thank God
   that the weather is fair and dry.
                                      
#   And then let them uncover the ship; and Noah says:- 

   Worship and thanks be to you, O Father.
   The earth has dried out.               1150
   I do not believe there are any people
   alive in field or meadow except us.
                                      
#   HIS WIFE
   Let God do his will and his pleasure,

#   GOD THE FATHER
   Noah, I command you,
   disembark from your ship immediately,

   every mother's son.
   So that you are sustained,

   he will find in Arabia,                1930
   on Mount Tabor, staves
   which Moses undoubtedly planted.
                                      
   Let him take them to Jerusalem
   for a boy will be born in Bethlehem
   who will redeem the world.             1935
   And a cross shall be made from them
   to crucify Christ my dear son.
   Blessed is he who worships him.
                                      
#   GABRIEL
   O Father, as you are full of grace
   I will do all your command,            1940
   as you wish, as I should,
   everywhere, without urging.
                                      
#   And then he shall come to king David, he being alone; and Gabriel
#   says:-- 
                                      
   David, go to Arabia
   to Mount Tabor at once.
   From there take three staves           1945
   which Moses planted
   and quickly bring them home
   with you to Jerusalem.
                                      
   There will indeed be a need of them
   for mankind one coming day             1950
   when it will be necessary
   to make a cross out of them.
                                      
#   Then the king waking up, says, looking about:- 
                                      
#   KING DAVID
   Lord, you say well.
   I have seen in my dream
   a bright angel before me.              1955
                                      
   He ordered me to bring
   the staves of grace from Mount Tabor so
   that through them we would have salvation.
                                      
   My messenger, bring my charger
   to ride.                               1960
   All men of my household, come with me,
   noblemen and bondsmen.
                                      
#   MESSENGER
   My lord, by God's day,
   the noble steed is ready,
   also the bay charger,                  1965
   likewise hackney and palfrey
   are in noble array.
   Mount, lord, when you will.
                                      
#   KING DAVID
   Messenger, my blessing on you!
   I will ride there immediately.         1970
   Let us pray
   the Father God full of mercy
   that we are led so that
   we go there on the right road.

#               [Here let king David come down.] 

   In the name of God the Father of Heaven,
   I will mount,
   and may his spirit
   keep guard over my soul.

#                            Then he shall ride 

   Blessed be the time
   when the angel warned me.              1980
   Behold, we have come
   to the mount, without delay.
                                      
   Alight, every mother's son.
   See the staves before us,
   growing green.                         1985
   In exalted honour to our great God,
   I shall cut
   the staves of grace from the ground.
                                      
#   COUNSELLOR
   These are potent staves
   for you have never smelt savour        1990
   like this anywhere.
   God is in this place.
   I now know it well

#   A BLIND MAN 
   Dear Lord, help me                     2005
   with your staves in some way.
   I am blind, I cannot see.
   Bless me with them forthwith.
                                      
#   A LAME MAN
   Give me also, a cripple,
   strength to walk properly              2010
   and I will believe full
   that they are staves of great virtue.
                                      
#   A DEAF MAN 
   For a deaf man who does not hear anything,
   beloved king, by the grace of the Father,
   if I have help from the staves         2015
   I shall thank God all the more.
                                      
#   KING DAVID
   I will cure you, every one,
   if you will believe completely
   in being saved by virtue of the staves.
   In the name of the Father, and of the Son,
   and of the Holy Ghost,
   you will now be healed.
                                      
#   BLIND MAN
   May you be blessed, O Father.
   Now we are all undoubtedly cured
   indeed of our misery.                  2025
   Glory be to the Father God of Heaven!
   Now he has heard our voice.
   These are staves without equal.
                                      
#   KING DAVID 
#        [Here let him get down from his horse.]

   Now let all dismount,
   but before going into the tower,       2030
   tell me, assembly:
   where shall the staves be planted
   to be most greatly honoured
   and to grow the best?
                                      
#   COUNSELLOR 
   While we are considering,              2035
   leave the three to lie
   on a green plot
   and appoint guards
   to watch them diligently
   and guard them on pain of severe punishment.
                                      
#   KING DAVID
   On my faith that is excellent advice.
   Butler I command (you)
   and your comrade, on pain of being drawn
   and hanged, to watch them
   so that they are not in any way        2045
   moved to another place.
                                      
   For I always want to sleep a little
   before eating.
   I am wearied from much travelling.
   Indeed I want to rest.                 2050
                                      
#   MESSENGER 
   I will guard them with great honour
   so that no man in this world,
   though he be king or emperor,
   is bold enough to take them away.
                                      
#   BUTLER
   No emperor or king of the land         2055
   or sultan, however great he may be,
   can move them
   in spite of his eyes.
   I will always keep the staves of grace
   in Jerusalem.                          2060
                                      
#   MESSENGER
   Lie on one side, mate,
   and keep a sharp watch all along,
   to the front and to the side.
   If some fellow comes and steals
   the staves from us secretly            2065
   all shame will be upon our kind.
                                      
#   BUTLER
   No, he will not steal, by my ballock
   however big a lout he is
   or how brash his bearing.
   Sleep on your belly and rest.          2070
   If you want a girl
   I will soon bring you to her.
                                      
#   Then the king, waking from sleep, shall go to the staves and he
#   says:--

#   KING DAVID
   I have rested quietly.
   How sweet morning sleep is!
   May God the Father ever be praised     2075
   in his work.
   So that I may have grace from him
   I will go and plant
   the staves with great honour
   In some place fair and bright.         2080
                                      
#   SECOND MESSENGER
   Dear lord, be of good cheer,
   a wondrous thing has happened.
   In the night, surely, these staves
   have all taken root in the earth
   and the three have joined into one     2085
   since you went away.
                                      
#   KING DAVID
   Praise to the Father, Lord of Heaven,
   I pray from the fullness of my heart
   for he is almighty and wonderful
   in every act.                          2090

#                   [He shall go to the staves.]

   They will stand In the place where
   they are since they are planted by him.
   Woe to him who does not do his will.
   He will have great sorrow.
                                      
   So as to honour the tree               2095
   my will is that a garland is made
   around it of silver
   in order to know what its extent may be.
                                      
#   BUTLER
   There is one ready for you
   made of silver pure and fine.          2100
   I will put it round it
   so that it is possible to know truly
   and see how much it grows
   in a full year.
                                      
                                      
#   And king David says to Bathsheba [washing her garment in a stream]:- 
#   KING DAVID

   reveal to me of your love,
   for I have never yet seen
   anywhere a woman
   who pleases me better.
                                      
   I will give you my tower, hall, and chamber.
   I will be your husband.

#   BATHSHEBA
   My dearly beloved lord,
   you are a king over all the world.
   How delightful it would be for me,     2115
   to carry out your pleasure
   if only I could without dissimulation
   and fear of being found out.
   If the wretch knew,
   I would be slain immediately.          2120

#       [Let Bathsheba go home with king David.] 

#   KING DAVID
   Bathsheba, flower of all the world,
   for love of you
   Sir Uriah will surely be slain.
   I swear it to you by my loyalty.
   For all my longing will always         2125
   most truly be for you for ever.
   Lie stretched out in the bed
   so that I can sleep with you.
                                      
#   BATHSHEBA
   I cannot refuse you
   but I will grant you everything        2130
   you ask of me.
   Slay him, my sweet lord,
   or he will harm me
   if he hears about our dalliance.
                                      
#   KING DAVID
   Darling,                               2135
   God has made you the foremost blossom
   of my loving heart.
#   of my loving heart.[4](12)
   He shall surely die for love of you.
                                      
#   KING DAVID
   Uriah, my best knight,
   I would beg you                        2140
   as you love me to take with you a host
   well armed for battle.
   I have a mighty enemy
   rampaging over my land.
   I cannot ride.                         2145
   There is a disease in my body.
                                      
#   URIAH
   Sire, dear lord, I will at once
   do everything whatsoever is in my power
   as you wish, without being urged and,
   as I am a trusty knight,               2150
   I will never leave the field
   until that fellow has paid the price.
                                      
#   KING DAVID
   Oh, Uriah, how noble you are.
   I love you greatly, on my (soul's?) peril,
   for your answers are fair.             2155
   Take care to be in forefront
   so that you are not thought a coward,
   nor fearful of any man.
                                      
#   URIAH 
   My lord, I swear to you,
   by the Order I have received,          2160
   no man shall prove cowardice against me,

   to strike a blow in the campaign,
   and to prove my prowess.
                                      
   Farewell, my best of lords.            2165

   Bathsheba, my own darling,             2175
   I really must journey
   to a battle,
   but it will soon be finished.

#            [Here Uriah is prepared and armed.]

   Do not ever go from me
   upon my soul.                          2180
   My heart breaks

   My lord, by my loyalty,
   I will break my neck, crack,
   if you go away from home now.          2185

   I say to you, Uriah,                   2205
   have no fear about me,
   never indeed,

   I tell you
   on my soul.                            2210
#            And then they shall ride off stage. 
#   And afterwards the messenger comes, and says to King David:- 

   Joy to you my lord!
   Look, I have come
   home again,
   but Sir Uriah is killed
   and your butler also.                  2215
   Woe is me because of them.
                                      
#   KING DAVID 
   What? is Sir Uriah dead?
   Tell me, as you love me,
   what death he had
   and how he was slain,                  2220
   for he was proud and unyielding
   and reckoned himself a mighty man.
                                      
#   MESSENGER 
   He is dead, by God's day.
   He tried to create a tumult
   and gave cruel blows                   2225
   but a knight slew him
   and quickly brought him to the ground
   and hacked him to pieces.
                                      
#   Then an angel shall come to king David, and ask him a question; and he
#   says:- 
                                      
#   GABRIEL
   Answer me, mighty king:
   A man had a hundred sheep              2230
   and his neighbour only one.
   If he stole it from him,
   what punishment would befall him?
   Tell me the certain truth.
                                      
#   KING DAVID
   I will answer you at once              2235
   so that you will certainly not be delayed.
   By a true judgment
   it should surely befall him
   to suffer being slain.
   Indeed, death is right                 2240
   for anyone
   who behaved like that.
                                      
#   GABRIEL
   This is how you have behaved,
   and from Uriah you have
   surely carried off his only wife, David,
   and you had women enough
   and plenty.
   Suffer you own judgment!
                                      
#   KING DAVID

   all the masons in the city
   to come here in the morning
   on pain of hanging and drawing         2280
   to make a wall of noble stones
   and of lime in the middle of the town.
   In honour of God
   I will create a temple in this town.
                                      
#   MESSENGER
   Lord, I will do your will,             2285
   all that is in my power, everything,
   everywhere as I should above all.
   I will not delay any longer.
   Farewell, my best of lords,
   for I will make haste.                 2290
                                      
#   KING DAVID
   Journey well, messenger,
   for you are an ungrudging envoy.
   There is no fault seen in you.
   Before going, have a drink of wine or mead
   and you will surely go on my errand    2295
   all the quicker, I do believe.
                                      
#   MESSENGER
   Pay attention here. Listen to me,
   all masons in the city, every one.
   Take care to work around the temple
   in the middle of the town              2300
   tomorrow without any tricks
   on pain of hanging and drawing.
                                      
#   And he shall come again to the king; and he says to him:- 
                                      
   My lord, joy to you!
   All the masons, great and small,
   have been alerted                      2305
   and they have answered me
   that they will be ready
   every one in the morning.
                                      
#   KING DAVID
   Messenger, I will reward you
   for your service.                      2310
   I will make a charter of
   Carnsew and Trehembys for you.
                                      
#   MESSENGER
   Thank you, noble lord,
   for your gifts are always good.
   You are generous beyond (all) people in the world,
   giving me a gift like this.

   You boy, get some lime and clay ready,
   building stones, hammers, and chisels,
   and I will hurry inside,
   to build the walls.                    2320

   They were begun by me
   beforehand with rammers.
   If you do not all make haste
   you will be badly beaten.
                                      
#   KING DAVID
   Counsellor, let us go immediately      2325
   and see to the workmen.
   If they do not work well
   they will be severely dealt with.

#                           [Here he goes down.]
#   COUNSELLOR
   Sire, dear, most gracious lord,
   all the chief workmen of the land      2330
   who can be found
   are working for you.
                                      
                                      
#              [Let God be in the playing area.]
#   GOD THE FATHER
   David, you will certainly never
   make me a house.
   The reason is that you are a murderer. 2335
   You have indeed destroyed
   the image of my own face,
   Uriah, who was a trusty knight.
                                      
#   KING DAVID
   So who will finish building
   all your house, Lord ?                 2340
                                      
#   GOD THE FATHER
   Solomon, your dearest son
   indeed will complete the building.

#                            [Here God goes up.]
                                      
#   KING DAVID
   Now I know truly
   that my time has come.
   I have lived a long time.              2345

#                    [David shall go to bed][6](15)

   Lords, I pray you
   crown Solomon my son
   and take him as your king
   as long as you live in this world.
   Honour him like me,                    2350
   for God has manifested him to you
   and that is his will.
                                      
#   MESSENGER 
   Lord, I will do your will
   in all things as is my duty
   whatever may occur.                    2355
   If such were God's will,
   I would never wish for anyone
   other than you, so must I go.
                                      
#   KING DAVID
   For sure, dear God (praise him)
   does not wish me to live here          2360
   with you any longer.
   O Father, into your hands
   I commend my spirit.
   Preserve it from fantasy.

#                And then king David shall die. 

#   COUNSELLOR 
   Oh! Woe                                2365
   that our peerless lord is dead.
   Let us go and lay his body in the grave,
   and let us pray for his soul,
   that God will be full of pity.
   May he bring it to him to his banquet. 2370
                                      
#   And he shall bury him, and carry the body under some tent, and shall
#   go to Solomon; and the messenger says:- 
                                      
#   MESSENGER
   Let us go and fetch Solomon
   and set him in his throne
   like a king in his seat
   that he may be crowned
   as we were commanded                   2375
   by his father before his passing.

#                   [Here Solomon shall parade.]
#   COUNSELLOR
   Joy to you, Solomon.
   Come quickly with us to the throne
   of your father David
   for you are chosen as king for us      2380
   and you will surely be crowned
   in a short time.

#   Here king Solomon shall parade if he wishes.
                                      
#   KING SOLOMON 
   Most joyful thanks, my lords,
   to you for the honour
   which you intend to do me.             2385
   If I am alive for a year
   I will repay it to you, by my head,
   whosoever may object.

#                      [Here Solomon goes down.] 
#   MESSENGER 
   Solomon, now go into your tower,
   for you will forthwith be crowned      2390
   ruler and king.
                                      
   Also sit in your throne
   which your father David possessed
   for he has bequeathed it to you.

   stone-cutters and roofers
   so that the temple may be completed.
                                      
#   MESSENGER 
   Sire, lord, by St. Gylmyn,

   God, what a fine tree for rafters,
   with straight sides,
   a large rounded lower end
   and its top and branches slender.
   I will cut beams                       2445
   and complete cross members and corbels.
                                      
#   KING SOLOMON
   God speed, workmen!
   It seems to me that
   you work very diligently.
   Build good walls                       2450
   with lime and clay
   and a strong top on them.
                                      
#   FIRST MASON
   Sire, I tell you,
   the walls are now completed,
   dead true by my faith.                 2455
   I shall be absolutely sure about them
   that no man will find a fault in them,
   in any wall, by this day.
                                      
#   KING SOLOMON
   Right well said, dear friend.
   Your work pleases me well.             2460
   You are two good men indeed
   and because your work is good
   I will give you the parish of Budock
   and the Seal Rock with its land.
#   and the Seal Rock [9](18) with its land.

   What generosity! Oh thank you!         2465
   We may be very merry
   to receive a gift like that!
                                      
   Now there are really no master-men
   in this country except us,
   my masons, in this land.               2470
                                      
#   SECOND CARPENTER
   Mate, let's offer the rafters
   to see if they are true to the walls
   so they can be assembled
   with the corbels, laths, and cross-members,
   and roofed over with planks,           2475
   so that they are a joy to behold.
                                      
#   FIRST CARPENTER
   No need to try anything.
   Just help me, mates,
   to put the timber up,
   so they can be fixed.                  2480
   There ought to be a strong beam in the
   middle of the house so there is no weakness.
                                      
#   SECOND CARPENTER
   By God's fast, well said.
   This timber is made even
   and true to the walls.                 2485
   Roofers, every one,
   roof over the temple, without delay
   so that the rain will not reach the rafters.
                                      
#   KING SOLOMON
   Certainly, workmen,
   others than you shall not cover it,    2490
   for you are skilled in every craft.
   But tell me truly,
   where shall we find a tree for a joist
   which is as straight as a spear-shaft?
                                      
#   FIRST CARPENTER
   Without a lie, by my faith,            2495
   there is not a joist in all your forests
   any use for any thing at all for it,
   nor in any region of this land
   except one tree with garlands
   of silver around it.                   2500
                                      
#   KING SOLOMON
   Upon my word, I would be very reluctant
   to cut that,
   but since no other can be found,
   go and cut it without delay
   to the glory of God, praise him,       2505
   and measure it accurately.
                                      
#   SECOND CARPENTER
   Don't be afraid of that my dear lord.
   God knows I will measure it
   well enough
   with a true square and pattern         2510
   so that it is not longer than my mark.
   It will not be shorter in any way.
                                      
#   FIRST CARPENTER
   Here it is well measured.
   No man in the world will measure it better.
   I will cut it exactly here, and you position
   it accurately with all your strength.
                                      
#   SECOND CARPENTER
   Confusion on your head!
   You kept to the line so well
   before cutting at the tree!
   It was a cubit too short!              2520
                                      
#   FIRST CARPENTER
   Bring it to the ground, I beg you.
   It will soon be put right.
   I will scarf it properly straight away.
   You need not be angry with me.
   Now, certainly, it is the right length.2525
   Let us adjust it quickly in its place.
                                      
#   SECOND CARPENTER
   The devil adjust you to his maw!
#   The joist will not locate [10](21) in its place.
   The joist will not locate in its place.
   It is a cubit too long.
   Cut it in the exact middle of the scarf
   and if it is not right,
   I don't know what we shall say.
                                      
#   FIRST CARPENTER 
   We'll cut it as you say.
   That is the middle, on my faith,
   by every mark in this world.           2535
   I will cut it here,
   exactly in two by the Lord God,
   and no more, surely, ever.
                                      
#   SECOND CARPENTER
   Let us lift it up, in God's name.
   Now it is too short, by a good cubit.  2540
   Truly, this is an embarrassment.
   Let us go to the king
   and testify to him that
   the beam will not fit properly.
                                      
#   FIRST CARPENTER 
   My lord king Solomon,                  2545
   many strange things have occurred
   in connection with this joist.
                                      
   One way it is too long,
   the other way it is actually too short,
   no matter how carefully it is measured.2550
                                      
#   KING SOLOMON
   Since it is so,
   I command it to be taken
   immediately with great honour
   to lie in the temple
   and all take care to worship it        2555
   on pain of your being slain.
                                      
#   KING SOLOMON
   And you, esteemed carpenters,
   look out in my forests
   for a tree for a joist, flawless indeed.
   Let it be truly wrought by you.        2560
                                      
#   SECOND CARPENTER
   I know where there is one cut,
   and quite fully shaped
   if it is the right length for us.
                                      
#   FIRST CARPENTER 
   For God's sake, come on then
   and bring it safely to the city        2565
   so it can be measured.
                                      
#   SECOND CARPENTER
   It's lying there.
   I have measured it
   twice for this same job.
                                      
#   FIRST CARPENTER
   It will come on our backs              2570
   to the town, to put in its place,
   for it is very good for the job.
                                      
#   SECOND CARPENTER
   Let us put the timber in its place.
   Dear God, send me strength
   that it may stand.                     2575
                                      
#   FIRST CARPENTER
   Upon my word, we would not find
   a straighter timber anywhere

#   SECOND CARPENTER
   Let us go and tell our lord

   that the temple is completed.

#   FIRST CARPENTER
   Much thanks, peerless lord.            2595
   We can be quite proud.
   Without doubt men have never received
   such good gifts, by my hood.
                                      
#   KING SOLOMON
   I will now ordain
   a cleric of my personal staff          2600
   to be a bishop in the temple.
   I will consecrate him straight away
   to maintain the law,
   to sing the service to God.
                                      
#        The counsellor shall be bishop; and he says:- 
                                      
#   COUNSELLOR
   Sire, lord, may God reward you         2605
   for giving me
   a high rank like that.
   It is befitting to serve you faithfully.
   There is none like you in this world
   for promoting your servants.           2610
                                      
#   [Here the counsellor puts on clerical dress.] 
                                      
#   KING SOLOMON
   On my word, it was already decided
   to promote you.
   The first benefice I have
   I will consecrate you bishop.
   Take up your mitre forthwith           2615
   and be faithful in your service.

#       [Here he gives the mitre to the bishop.]
                                      
#   BISHOP
   Since you so wish it
   I will receive it
   in praise to the Father of Heaven.
                                      
   If it is God's will for the best,      2620
   I will say service to him
   forthwith in the temple.
                                      
#   [Here the bishop goes down, and will cross over to the temple.]
                                      
   In honour to God the Father,
   I command forthwith,
   let all speak praise,                  2625
   and after that, let each one of us all
   around drink a draught of wine
   to comfort his heart.
                                      
#   And then they shall pray, and speak low, as if saying prayers; and
#   Maximilla shall come into the temple, and she sits upon the timber
#   (per Bakere; other versions of the story make it clear this is the
#   meaning of stuppa, not stove as in Norris. [R.E.]) and her clothes are
#   set on fire by the timber and she cries out, saying:-- 
                                      
#   MAXIMILLA
   O Father God, through your mercy,
   send me a cure                         2630
   for my disease with which I am afflicted.
   Oh! oh! oh! alas! woe is me!
   My clothes are blazing
   from the wood of Christ, I believe.
                                      
   My dear Lord Christ Jesus,             2635
   God of Heaven, quell the strength
   of the flame and fire through your power,
   as Adam and Eve also
   will be redeemed by your body
   and sent to heaven in glory.           2640
                                      
#   BISHOP
   What vengeance to you, you fool?
   Where have you heard God called Christ
   by any man born in this world?
                                      
   I have the law of Moses,
   and in all that                        2645
   his name is not written,
                                      
   nor does it say there is any other God
   but the Father of Heaven above;
   and you, girl, the other woman's daughter
   you make yourself your own god.        2650
   I'll be hanged by the jaws
   if you ever get away from us
   before you pay for it horribly
   and recant completely all your talk.
                                      
#   MAXIMILLA
   I will not recant, foolish bishop,     2655
   for the three staves, indeed,
   were planted by David
   and he joined them into one,
   surely as a valid symbol
   of the three persons in the Trinity.   2660

#        [Here the bishop goes up to his booth.] 

#   [One is the Father of Heaven,
   One is the Father of Heaven,
   another, Christ his only Son,
   who will be born of a virgin,
   and the Holy Ghost is the third,
   three and one, dwelling                2665
   in one Godhead, I believe.
#   in one Godhead, I believe.]
                                      
#   BISHOP
   Out upon you, most horrid wench,
   no doubt a haughty witch!
   However proud you are you will pay for it.
   Near for sorrow I am quite mad.        2670
                                      
   You rogue, for God's blood,
   give me counsel like a man.
                                      
#   CROSIER-BEARER
   I give you counsel without a charge.
   My telling is no fable.
   If you intend to put her to death,     2675
   order your men to beat her
   with stones, and do not let them stop
   at all until she is quite dead.
                                      
#   BISHOP
   Well said, by God's fast.
   If God helps me, you are good,         2680
   and a wise man in the advice you give.
   Executioners, great and small,
   come forth every one
   now according to my needs.
                                      
#   FIRST EXECUTIONER
   Hail, my lord, proud and noble,        2685
   My brow is covered with sweat by this day,
   through rushing to you.
   Tell me what to do please straight away.
   If I can, I will do it,
   on my soul.                            2690
                                      
#   BISHOP
   Go and drag the wretched woman
   who is making false gods
   out of our temple
   and batter her with stones
   until she dies.                        2695
   Don't stop at all.
                                      
#   SECOND EXECUTIONER
   Let's not stop, by God's soul,
   for we intend to strike hard
   until we are weary.
   Come outside in the devil's name.      2700
   You will never drink soup.
   You will be quite dead.
                                      
#   THIRD EXECUTIONER
   Look out, let me strike out
   a fearful blow with a mallet
   at the vile slut on the forehead,      2705
   so that she will never eat
   but stink and rot
   like fish-oil or salt-marsh mud.
                                      
#   FOURTH EXECUTIONER 
   I will hit her with a club.
   I don't know that there was ever a blow
   which gave such a hard whack
   as I bruise her under the skin,
   so that both flesh and fell,
   are covered in putrefaction.
                                      
#   FIRST EXECUTIONER
   Forthwith, most gracefully             2715
   I will now give a mighty blow
   precisely on the breast in front
   until she falls to the ground,
   and beat her up viciously,
   not gently, as small as malt sprouts.  2720
                                      
#   MAXIMILLA
   Lord Jesus Christ of Heaven,
   have mercy on my soul
   as I am tortured for you.
   Because I called upon you
   once I am surely being slain.          2725
   Forgive me my sin, I pray you.
                                      
#   SECOND EXECUTIONER
   Did you hear, comrades,
   how the vile slut is
   calling on what will not be?
                                      
   She had expected to mock               2730
   the bishop, and beguile him
   into worshipping new gods.
                                      
#   THIRD EXECUTIONER
   And for that I want
   to clout her on the jaw
   and batter her limbs.                  2735
   You filthy bitch, you gutter-snipe,
   you will die beyond any doubt,
   notwithstanding your God or his power.
                                      
#   FOURTH EXECUTIONER
   We don't give a fart for his power
   in spite of his father and his mother. 2740
   The wench shall be killed.
   You'll soon be done for.
   Every bit of your bones
   will be beaten up with my bashing.

#                        [Here Maximilla dies.]
#   FIRST EXECUTIONER
   Stop, you ruffians,                    2745
   for the wench is already dead
   through my blows
   and her heart blood has run out.
   Let us go quickly and report
   to our bishop that it is done.         2750
                                      
#   SECOND EXECUTIONER
   Silence, comrade, I beg you.
   I don't believe for a moment
   that the whore is dead yet.
   Before going away
   I will still give her a clout          2755
   with great rough granite stones.
                                      
                                      
#   THIRD EXECUTIONER
   All hail, dear sir bishop.
   Now the wench is dead.
   She lies stretched out.
   In spite of suffering death            2760
   she did not retract her words
   at the beginning or the end.
                                      
#   BISHOP
   That is not a matter of importance.
   She has her reward
   and she was served as was her due.     2765
   For your labour you will receive
   Bohelland and Bosaneth.
   Go at once and take possession of them
   before it is night.
                                      
   I will give                            2770
   you this town
   and all the Canonry of the Close.
#   and all the Canonry of the Close.[11](27)
                                      
#   FOURTH EXECUTIONER
   What largesse, courteous bishop,
   What largesse, let every one call!
   All together, say 'largesse!'          2775
   It is fitting always to serve well
   a true bishop like this
   for he is noble as you can see.
                                      
                                      
#   BISHOP
   Come away, Gebal.
   Put the wood outside with a will       2780
   and let Amalek help you.
                                      
   And cast it little by little
   right into Bethsaida,
   as it is a bone of contention.

#       [Here he carries the wood to Bethsaida.]
                                      
#   GEBAL
   Now it will be carried.                2785
   Amalek, may you be hanged!
   Hold it tight at the one end!
                                      
#   AMALEK
   Let us take it immediately
   and run at full tilt
   and put the timber into the water.     2790

#            [A messenger comes to the bishop.]
                                      
#   MESSENGER
   Dear lord, what you are doing
   is not of any use at all
   but it brings you more dishonour,
   for they are saying that
   since it went to the place             2795
   the sick are being cured by it
                                      
   so that you are being blamed
   very forcefully because
   you dragged it from the temple
   although it has so much virtue.        2800
                                      
#   BISHOP
   That is of no consequence.
   I know another good plan
   for me to carry out, by this day.
   There is no bridge over the water of Cedron.
   I will at once order                   2805
   men to drag it there,
                                      
   so that it will be trodden under foot
   and its virtue unfailingly reduced
   by the dirt.
   Amalek and Gebal,                      2810
   carry the timber immediately
   over the water of Cedron to be a bridge.
                                      
#   AMALEK
   Gebal, your neck will hang
   immediately unless you carry
   the one end to the water of Cedron.    2815
   I will grab its very rough end.
   (He's absolutely choked by grief.
   His heart will not be joyful.)
                                      
#   [Here he brings back the wood from Bethsaida over the water of
#   Cedron.] 
                                      
#   GEBAL
   No wonder I had grief,
   carrying the timber around,            2820
   and we shan't get paid for it.
   Carry it, and good luck to you.
   Now we are worn out by it,
   and our limbs are very weary.
                                                                            
#   KING SOLOMON
   Good people, you have seen             2825
   how God the Father created
   heaven and earth according to his judgment.
                                      
   After that he willed
   Adam and Eve, through his grace.
   Indeed, he also made them              2830
   just like himself.
                                      
   All the world he gave to them
   so that they and their children
   who were born of them
   might live in it for ever.             3835
                                      
   His fullest blessing upon you,
   men, women and
   children.
   The play is now ended.
                                      
   And to see the Passion                 2840
   of Jesus
   which Christ suffered for us
   of his own free will, come in time tomorrow.
   And let all go home.
                                      
   In the name of the Father,             2845
   gracious minstrels, pipe up immediately.
